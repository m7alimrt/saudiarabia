                <p> Saudi Arabia, officially known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is one of the most influential nations in the Middle East. The country is led from Riyadh by King Salman and Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman. Spanning from the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba to its west to the Arabian Gulf to its west, Saudi Arabia is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert, lowland, steppe, and mountains. The area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of mainly four distinct historical regions: Hejaz, Najd, Al-Ahsa, and 'Asir. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by King Abdulaziz. He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. The ultraconservative Wahhabi religious movement within Sunni Islam has been described as a "predominant feature of Saudi culture", although the power of the religious establishment has been significantly eroded in the 2010s. In its Basic Law, Saudi Arabia continues to define itself as a sovereign Arab Islamic state with Islam as its official religion, Arabic as its official language, and Riyadh as its capital.
                    Its largest city is Riyadh, and the financial and administrative capital is located here. The country is home to Mecca and Madinah, the two holiest cities in Islam, and millions of Muslim pilgrims come to Mecca and Madinah from across the world to complete their obligatory pilgriamge, known as Hajj. </p>

                <h2 class="bigt" >History of the Kingdom</h2>
                <p>&emsp;The Kingdom's lands have been continously inhabited for over 5,000 years, mostly by tribes who lived off the desert and traded with nearby empires. In 570 BC, the future Kingdom's fate was sealed with the birth of the Prophet Muhammad. Muhammad was born in Mecca, amongst the Polytheistic tribes of Quraish. Muslims believe that Allah sent His final revelation in the form of the Quran, to the people of Mecca through His Messenger, Muhammad. This occurred first in and around Mecca and then in Medina beginning in 622 C.E., which marks the first year of the Hijrah (1 A.H.). By the time Muhammad died (in Medina in 632 C.E.), almost all communities in Arabia had declared loyalty to him as a political leader and to Islam. Muslims view Muhammad not as the creator of a new religion, but as the restorer of the original, uncorrupted monotheistic faith of Adam, Abraham, Moses and Jesus. Islam's first caliph Abu Bakr completed the process of conversion. Arabian converts carried the religion throughout the Middle East and north Africa. The rise of Islam and the subsequent religious importance of the Arabian cities of Mecca and Medina (two of the holiest places in Islam), have given the rulers of this territory significant influence beyond the peninsula.  </p>
                <p>The first Saudi state was established in 1744, when leader Sheikh Mohammed ibn Abd al Wahhab settled in Diriyah and Prince Mohammed Ibn Saud agreed to support and espouse his cause. After studying in the Hijaz and Iraq, Sheikh Muhammad Al Abd al-Wahab (who died in 1792), returned to Najd and preached and wrote against practices that deviated from Islam. He urged his followers, who became known as muwahidun, to end polytheistic practices and adhere strictly to the Quran and the Hadiths (the sayings and doings of the Prophet). The movement involved military struggle, preaching, the establishment of Quranic schools, the setting up of new communities, and the creation of a bureaucratic state that ruled in Najd. The House of Saud, with other allies, rose to become the dominant state in Arabia controlling most of the Nejd, but not either coast. This Saudi state lasted for about 75 years. </p> 
                <p>On January 8, 1926, Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud became the King of Hejaz. On January 29, 1927, he took the title King of Nejd (his previous Nejdi title was sultan). By the Treaty of Jeddah, signed on May 20, 1927, the United Kingdom recognized the independence of Abdul Aziz's realm (then known as the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd). In 1932, these regions were unified as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The discovery of oil on March 3, 1938, transformed the country. Development programs, which were delayed due to the onset of the Second World War in 1939, began in earnest in 1946 and by 1949 production was in full swing. Oil has provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and a great deal of leverage in the international community. Boundaries with Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait were established by a series of treaties negotiated in the 1920s, with two neutral zones created, one with Iraq and the other with Kuwait. After Saudi Arabia declared its neutrality during World War II (1939–45), Britain and the United States subsidized Saudi Arabia, which declared war on Germany in 1945, and this thus enabled the kingdom to enter the United Nations as a founding member. Ibn Saud also joined the Arab League, but he did not play a leading part in it, since the religious and conservative element in Saudi Arabia opposed cooperation with other Arab states, even when Saudis shared common views, as in opposition to Zionism. In the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, Saudi Arabia contributed only one battalion.</p>
                <p>Saudi Arabia has undergone significant changes since 1950. In the post-World War II era, the country experienced rapid economic development as a result of its vast oil reserves. In 1953, King Saud came to power and established a number of ambitious modernization programs, including the creation of a national education system and the expansion of infrastructure. However, by the 1960s, there were growing concerns about corruption and economic mismanagement, and in 1964 King Saud was replaced by his brother, King Faisal. Under King Faisal's leadership, the government implemented a series of economic and social reforms, including the introduction of a modern legal system and the promotion of women's rights. In the 1970s, Saudi Arabia's wealth and influence grew significantly, and the country played a leading role in the formation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Since the 1980s, the country has continued to modernize and diversify its economy, while also facing various regional and international challenges, such as the Gulf War and the ongoing conflict in Yemen. In recent years, the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman has unveiled a series of ambitious economic and social reforms, known as Vision 2030, which aims to reduce the country's dependence on oil and promote economic diversification and modernization.</p>   
                <h2>Future of the Kingdom</h2>
                <p> The future of Saudi Arabia is uncertain, but it is likely that the country will continue to face a number of economic, social, and political challenges. In terms of the economy, Saudi Arabia will likely continue its efforts to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil. The government has already begun implementing a number of ambitious economic and social reforms, such as Vision 2030, which aims to create new jobs and spur economic growth. Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman aims to bring the world to the Kingdom, which has long been off limits to tourists, through new attractions such as Neom, The Line, The Red Sea Project, AlUla and more.  
    
                    Socially, Saudi Arabia is undergoing a period of rapid change, with increasing numbers of women entering the workforce and a growing youth population. The government has also begun to relax some of the strict social restrictions that have long been in place, such as allowing women to drive and opening up more entertainment options.
                            
                    Politically, the future of Saudi Arabia is closely tied to the stability and succession of the royal family. The country is currently ruled by King Salman, who has been in power since 2015, and his son Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman has been widely seen as the architect of many of the recent reforms. There is also a question of how the country will handle the rising regional and international pressure from countries like Iran and the US.</p>

                    <h2>Places to Visit in Saudi Arabia</h2>
                    <h3>Riyadh</h3>
                    <p>Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s capital and main financial hub, is located in the country’s center. Landmarks include the 302m-high Kingdom Centre located in the King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD), with a sky bridge connecting 2 towers, the 267m-high Al Faisaliah Centre, with a glass-globe summit. In the historical Ad-Diriyah district, the Masmak Fort marks the site of the 1902 raid that gave the Al Saud dynasty control of Riyadh</p>

                    <h3>Al Ula </h3>
                    <p>The ancient city of AlUla dates back millennia and is a spectacularly preserved cultural and historical masterpiece. With 200,000 years of human history to uncover, it was once the capital of the North Arabian Lihyanites and then the Nabataeans, and served as a meeting place for pilgrims, merchants and explorers. For a history fanatic like myself, this key location of the incense, spice and silk routes that linked Arabia, Egypt and India, is an intriguing enigma with countless mysteries to undercover.</p>

                    <p>Al Wajh is a city situated on the coast of the Red Sea and is known for its pristine beaches. The city is one and a half day’s drive from Al Ula and Hegra and is one of the largest cities in the Tabuk region. Al Wajh also played a major role during the Arab Revolt in the First World War. The city has numerous mosques, all of which are distinguished by their stunning architecture. Inside the city, there is also a fort called Al Wajh Castle, which was built in the 1870s. The castle was used as a fortification to protect Tabuk and later as government headquarters. Today the castle has been fully restored and turned into a museum that features the town’s history.</p>

                            <h3>Medina</h3>
                            <p>The second holiest city to over 1.7 billion Muslims around the world, Medina is one of the most beautiful cities in the Kingdom. The city existed for over 1,500 years before Muhammad's migration from Mecca, known as the Hijrah. Medina was the capital of a rapidly-increasing Islamic caliphate under Muhammad's leadership, serving as its base of operations and as the cradle of Islam, where Muhammad's Ummah composed of Medinan Ansar as well as those who immigrated with Muhammad Muhajirun, who were collectively known as the Sahabah, gained huge influence. Medina is home to three prominent mosques, namely al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Masjid Qubaʽa, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn, with the Masjid Qubaa being the oldest in Islam. Keep in mind non-Muslim visitors to Medina are prohibited from entering the Masjid Al-Nabawi, but unlike Mecca, the rest of the city is open to non-Muslims.</p>

                <h2>Customs and Rules</h2>
                <h3>What to Avoid</h3>
                <h4>Travel</h4>
                <p> Due to the ongoing conflict with Yemen, Houthi militias often launch rocket/missle strikes on major Saudi population centers, especially near the border with Yemen. While most are interecepted by Saudi Aerial Defense Systems, some have travelled as far as Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dhahran. If missile debris is found, stay away and contact local authorities. Excersise caution when travelling within 100 Kilometres of the Border, Including to Abha, Najran, Jizan, Khamis Mushayt, and Sharurah. Additionally, The Saudi Government has deemed the Hafr-al Bateen and Khafiji areas in the Eastern Province and ~25 km radius of the border with Iraq and Jordan off limits. Fines range up to 25,000 Saudi Riyals for violations. Due to the proximity to Iran to the East, as well as Yemen and Somalia to the South, Marine piracy is commonplace while travelling in the waters. Maintain extreme caution when travelling more than 20kms offshore by boat.</p>
                <h4>Safety</h4>
                <p>While the crime rate is low, petty crime does occur. Make sure to hide signs of affluence and/or travel and identity documents, particularly when travelling to crowded areas and holy sites. Roads in the major cities are well maintained, but in rural areas, especially in the South of the Kingdom, road conditions may be poor. Drivers in Saudi Arabia are internationally known for being very agressive and pay little attention to laws at times, so take caution when driving. For both male and female travellers, dress conservatively, particularly for female travellers traveling without a mehram. While Saudi Arabia is becoming more westernized, it is still an Islamic country, so be mindful of Islamic laws and conditions that may apply to your visit. Avoid publicly critising the Saudi Government or the Islamic faith, as this will inevitably lead to trouble with the Mutaween. Posession and Use of Drugs, Alcohol, Pork Products, or Porn are considered 'Haram' and strictly forbidden. </p>
